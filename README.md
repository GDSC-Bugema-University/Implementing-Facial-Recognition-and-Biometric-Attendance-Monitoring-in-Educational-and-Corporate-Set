# Implementing-Facial-Recognition-and-Biometric-Attendance-Monitoring-in-Educational-and-Corporate-Settings

***Problem***

> There is a need for a reliable and efficient system for tracking attendance in educational and corporate settings. Currently, many schools and companies rely on manual attendance tracking methods, such as sign-in sheets or ID card swipes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. There is also a growing concern about the ethical and privacy implications of using such methods, particularly in light of the increasing availability of facial recognition and biometric technology. As a result, there is a need for a solution that combines the reliability and efficiency of attendance tracking with the ethical and privacy considerations of using such technology.
